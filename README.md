In this particular module, as the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I will help the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions on future school budgets and priorities. Additionally, my primary task involves analyzing district-wide test results in order to aggregate/analyze their results in order to provide future recommendations for student success. 

These stats pertain to Math, Reading, Finances, etc.
